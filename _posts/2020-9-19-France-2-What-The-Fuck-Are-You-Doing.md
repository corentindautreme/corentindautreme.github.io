title: France 2, what the fuck are you doing?
---

In November 2019, France Télévisions confirmed they [would drop the short-lived Destination Eurovision](https://eurovoix.com/2019/11/30/france-destination-eurovision-dropped-as-internal-selection-confirmed-for-2020/) and revert back to an internal selection. Even if the given reason was the broadcaster’s desire to have more control over the selection process (ITV was (heavily? [(+)](#null "There were quite a few The Voice : La plus belle Voix - another ITV production - alumni in the line-up after all")) involved in picking the Destination Eurovision participants), one can’t help thinking the poor ratings of the show, as well as average results at Eurovision [(+)](#null "Looking at the figures, we objectively did better when selecting our act internally in 2016 and 2017 than we did when trusting the People in 2018 and 2019"), played in the decision making process. Although a strong defender of a national selection process myself (but that’s a story for another time), I understood the choice and was ready to give it a chance. Even more, I actually thought this fit perfectly in the grand scheme of things. France was finally (somewhat) back in the game, and in order to attract bigger names decided to go internal. Oh, I could already see Kendji Girac grabbing our 6th trophy on stage in Rotterdam! It’s also worth noting that France had just gotten a new Head of Delegation; I was surprised to hear that Steven Clérima had stepped down without a word as to why (and France 2 using, yet again, the “back to an in-house management!” argument - not sure what they were talking about as Clérima was, as far as I know, a France Télévision employee?...), and I had my doubts about the Head of Entertainment assuming once more the Head of Delegation position (uh-oh, [war flashbacks](https://twitter.com/Cowastakenso/status/1202906099881533445?s=20)), but sure, whatever, no reason to panic. Surprise me [(+)](#null "They did - be careful what you wish for").

No Kendji as we all know [(+)](#null "Keep your expectations in check, kids"). Instead, relatively unknown actor and singer-songwriter Tom Leeb was selected to represent France at the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest. Wiping the tears off my cheeks (not really) as I remembered that you don’t need to be a superstar to do well at the contest, I patiently waited for the song (that was to be selected separately) to be revealed.

And then it came, on a Sunday of February [(+)](#null "'You left meeee, on Suuuunday' - 'you' referring to any hope of us doing good that may have been left in me"). Leaking hours ahead of the official announcement, it was revealed that The Best in Me, a ballad resulting from a collaboration between Thomas G:son, Peter Boström and John Lundvik, was to be our entry in Rotterdam.

Ouch. Needless to say I wasn’t particularly pleased. Funnily enough I had just landed in Paris CDG, back from a one-week vacation, and for logistic reasons couldn’t listen to the song straight away. All I was left with for a few hours were all the not-frankly-enthusiastic tweets - and [I quickly understood we may have done something wrong](https://twitter.com/Cowastakenso/status/1229023436833480709?s=20). I eventually listened to it ahead of the evening’s official presentation and yeah, that was pretty bad. I didn’t even dislike it, I’m all in for cheesy ballads, but there was no way this was going to make it out of the bottom 5.

A few thoughts came to my mind, the main ones being 1) why did we get back to treating the contest like it was 2000 and 2) please tell me, the first year [(+)](#null "at least the first year in some time, I think? I haven’t done my homework on this but I’m pretty sure we’re not used to letting foreigners meddling in our Eurovision affairs") we open up to foreign contributions, we didn’t jump on the first Melfest reject popping on our radar just because it was written by the same dudes behind the most acclaimed Eurovision winner of modern times (ICYMI, G:son and Boström did [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfo-8z86x80)).

Oh, and 3) hang on, so the incumbent Head of Entertainment acting as Head of Delegation is internally selecting an old-fashioned song? [That sounds oddly familiar](https://twitter.com/Cowastakenso/status/1229094713720016897?s=20).

*Great Scott! Marty, we traveled back to 2015!*

Props to the delegation though, for managing to find the constructive suggestions among the shitstorm the reveal of the song had triggered and giving us Mon Alliée, a highly-requested acoustic revamp of The Best in Me that I’m convinced could have helped us helping the bottom 5 [(+)](#null "upper-half of the bottom 10, here we come! I still believe we have dodged a bullet this year").

I don’t want to be too harsh on Alexandra Redde-Amiel (our HoD). It was her first year, I’m sure she wanted to do well and everyone makes mistakes. And that’s our luck - we managed to get it wrong the one year ESC didn’t happen. It was all a rehearsal, a dry-run. It’s alright. Let’s do better in 2021. Lesson learned.

Or so I thought.

But before, a few words on Tom. He was, as others across Europe, not re-selected to compete for his country in 2021, both him and the broadcaster citing conflicting schedules [(+)](#null "Tom is also an actor and was set to star in a few productions - or at least that was the given explanation"). This made me sad, as I don’t think he was the issue in our 2020 attempt, and I strongly believe he should have been given the chance to come back - this time with his own music.

For 2021, France 2 chose to re-revert to a national selection, although not Destination Eurovision but a different format of which we (at the time this is written) know little [(+)](#null "a one-night event in a big venue that is not in Paris with a dozen songs competing").

So far so good, right? Well here comes what I think is an issue: the selection is to be hosted by Stéphane Bern. Furthermore, the head of delegation has doubled down on the broadcaster's intention to make Mr Bern "The face of Eurovision in France". And I have a problem with that.

So what's the deal with Stéphane Bern you may ask? I have nothing against the good sir, on the contrary I find him quite likeable. Now ask anyone in France what the first thing that comes to their mind is when they hear the name “Stéphane Bern”. First, they’ll ask you to repeat slowly (sorry, English just isn’t our thing), and then they’ll probably say something along the lines of “oh, that’s the dude who always hosts history shows and that old people watch!".

Mr Bern is indeed France Télévisions' Mister History. The man is impassioned in history and royal families, and when he pops on your TV you can be sure he'll talk about history. And Eurovision now it seems. Well, not “now”, he’s been commentating the contest every year since 2015 now, including Shine a Light in 2020 on a set surrounded by multiple intervenants.

But the thing is that people just see him as old fashioned. And no matter whether that's true or not (it bloody isn’t, why would history be old fashioned you pricks?), the damage is already done.

And that’s without counting that - and I say this with all the respect due to the person - when it comes to Eurovision, he’s frankly not doing a great job: his commentary is way too often inaccurate or even straight up wrong, and it just feels like he’s half-assing it. Just to mention an example, in 2019, he says early in the show that they had an intern write them little fact-sheets about each act. He must've read them in a hurry as he announced Ari Olafsson singing Hatrið Mun Sigra for Iceland(https://twitter.com/Cowastakenso/status/1129846170350772224?s=20). Credit where it’s due: this statement is interesting because there’s some truth in it. I’d guess the intern’s fact-sheet probably mentioned the previous year’s Icelandic act (who was Ari Olafsson), and Bern could have read it too fast (thus saying something stupid on national TV to roughly 5 million people, no big deal). But let’s not give him too much credit either: isn’t the job of a commentator to do some research? It wouldn’t take more than a couple hours (just read the official programme of the contest I assume you receive once on location like any other member of the press and pick your info there). If you’re going to put half the effort into it [(+)](#null "or ask someone to do the effort for you and then butcher their work"), why did you even take the job in the first place?

Needless to say, the choice of Stéphane Bern baffles me. If France 2 was able to listen to feedback regarding The Best in Me, why would they bury their head in the sand and pretend that this is the greatest idea ever?

So, to keep it short: France 2, what are you doing? From here it feels like you’re taking all the hard work that was done over the last 4 years and throwing it all out the window, and the French hardcore audience is losing faith. We’ve come so far and are so close to be the powerhouse we could be, yet it looks like you don’t want to, and that your new team is obsessed with having it their way with a complete disregard for the work and genuine suggestions of others. The contest has evolved so much through the years and is now this massive world-class production that’s in tune with his time and appeals to the young audiences. Open your eyes and react before you irreversibly cancel the previous delegation’s efforts.

Eurovision France, c’est vous qui décidez [(+)](#null "yes, we really called our selection this it seems. It means “Eurovision France, it is you who decide” - but the title is the least of my worries") is your chance to show us that you’ve learned from your mistakes, that you have done your homework and now know what Eurovision is.
