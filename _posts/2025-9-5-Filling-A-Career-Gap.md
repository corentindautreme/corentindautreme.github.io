title: Filling a career gap
---

In April 2025, I quit my job for personal relocation purposes, and remained unemployed until September 2025. I had never
gone through such a gap before, but I had a plan to keep busy, and I mostly stuck to it. In the end, my day-to-day
didn't turn out much different from what it was in my previous job. In this post, I'll go over the things I did.

## I moved to another country

The main reason I ended up with so much time on my hands was because I relocated to another country. To achieve that, I
emptied my home, sold it, and went through some paperwork. That kept me busy for the first few weeks.

## I rewrote the management app of a side project

**Objective**: Learn modern frontend development

I have this side project called Lys. I wrote an Android management app for it years ago and didn't bother to properly
maintain it. It grew old and slow. At the same time, I wanted to finally learn about modern frontend development using a
framework.

I rewrote this app as a responsive Next.js webapp and learned about React (components, states, etc.), Typescript,
Tailwind CSS, SWR caching, Vercel, as well as designing responsive webpages that don't entirely
suck. [Learn more](https://corentindautreme.github.io/portfolio#lys).

## I built an app for public transport in my new city

**Objective**: Get into Node.js backend development

This project started as an excuse to build a backend API using Typescript and Node.js. I didn't cram in as much learning
as I had hoped, but I still managed to learn a thing or two about Typescript, Prisma, Javascript testing and mocking
with Jest,
CI/CD, <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="Very useful to visit my (incredibly lovely, by the way - I really won the lottery when I married this woman ü•π) in-laws">
and Sarajevo trolleybus lines</span>. [Learn more](https://corentindautreme.github.io/portfolio#transit-planner).

## I made a portfolio

**Objective**: highlight side projects and associated learnings

I wanted to show some of my side projects and highlight certain aspects & learning points in more than a few lines on my
resume.

The result is a five and a half thousand HTML/CSS lines slide-based one-pager website filled with details, explanations,
and illustrations, carefully crafted to look neat on both desktop and
mobile. [Check it out!](https://corentindautreme.github.io/portfolio)

## I wrote blog posts

**Objective**: document findings & thought processes, and train my synthesis & transmission skills

I wrote a variety of blog posts on topics ranging from side project deep-dives to technical showcases and documentation,
namely:

* [Revisiting Lys, a Eurovision-flavored social media bot](https://corentindautreme.github.io/Revisiting-Lys-A-Eurovision-Flavored-Social-Media-Bot/)
* [Deploying an Express API to Vercel](https://corentindautreme.github.io/Deploying-An-Express-API-To-Vercel/)
* [AWS SDK - GetLogEvents does not return all LogEvents](https://corentindautreme.github.io/AWS-SDK-GetLogEvents-Does-Not-Return-All-LogEvents/)
* Filling a career gap _(this post)_

## I got married

I love her more than anything.

## And I also

* **killed dozens of rainbow goblins in Diablo 3** and I regret to report that I still haven't obtained the cosmic
  wings.
* **watched a lot of tennis**. That French Open Alcaraz-Sinner final was something wasn't it
* **drank a lot of Bosnian coffee** and yes, my d≈æezva overflew a couple of times
