title: Revisiting Lys, a Eurovision-flavored social media bot
---

I launched Lys back in late 2019 as a Twitter bot to post reminders about Eurovision national selection TV shows from
all over Europe. Five years later, it weathered a Twitter (now X) API mess, went through a well needed refactoring, got
a brand-new management app, and grew in scope to offer its services on 2 additional platforms and a very simple web
page -
all while still costing absolutely nothing in hosting. Let's revisit the thing, and discuss the various tips and tricks
in use to keep it
running <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="A French saying that says that the cost of something you benefit from is covered by a very rich someone - in my case, the princess is good old Jeff">

With Twitter losing its grace in favor of spawn-off Bluesky
and, <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="Months after Melon Husk bought the platform and turned it into an absolute shitshow, driving advertisers to run off as, apparently, being shown next to literal n*zis isn't a great look">

Threads, a platform hastily put together by Meta
to fill what was more and more shaping to become a void in the World Wide Web, it became <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="In the case of Threads, a fun challenge is all it was - it boasts a grand total of 20 followers there (against well over 400 on Bluesky)">relevant, and a fun
challenge</span>, to deploy Lys to more platforms. Threads, with its (now fulfilled) ambition
to <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="Anytime now in the EU I'm sure (edit: I started writing this article in December 2024 (I know I know), came back to it in August 2025, and we're still waiting lol)">
open up to the Fediverse</span>, was
particularly interesting to the goal of making the bot more available to a fleeing Eurovision Twitter community - sadly,
it took a whole year of waiting for the team at Meta to finally open up a basic API.

I started with Bluesky, not only as I had gotten an invite code from a uni friend in the summer of 2023, but also
because it was
the <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="Oh don't give me that look, Mastodon is a complicated hot mess alright">
only</span> platform to 1) be actually accessible to us UE peasants (\*) and 2) come with an API.

(\*) _I posted this banger of a... thread before Meta aggressively cut off access to the backend from the EU and COME ON
how did it get so few likes??_

But I digress - Bluesky, was I saying. While Lys was very much a live project, the code base itself was still a hot mess
of a proof of concept that I refused to refactor. So, naturally, adding Bluesky was not only a pain, but also
extraordinarily ugly, and it was promising to be very annoying to maintain or expand to another platforms.

While on topic, a quick word of appreciation for the customization options offered by the Bluesky API - I particularly
appreciate the ability to turn any part of your posts into a link (using facets) and choose to embed or not a URL card.
More of that, API makers, please!

### üßµ Knot a Twitter clone

Threads eventually got an API, almost a whole year after launch. Aside from its little unique quirks (longer publication
time due to the decentralized nature of the platform, and long-lived tokens that need to be refreshed every couple of
months), it's your average social media API - no real challenge here.

What ended up taking most of my summer vacation was the inevitable refactoring of the Lys code base. The plan was to
move from a pile of if/else and duplicated code to a modular and extensible project that would support platform-specific
features (e.g. Bluesky's facets) and future additions (with Threads being the first, but, seeing how fast the web moves
nowadays, maybe not the last).

To keep it short, the Lys entrypoint is now a **publisher**, that is selected based on the input target (Bluesky,
Threads, or Twitter) and run mode (daily, weekly, or 5-minute reminder). Each publisher is built from a **generator**,
that generates a thread of social media posts, a **client**, that encapsulates the social media API logic, and,
optionally, a **formatter**, that enriches the posts before publishing.

Now, if I want to support a new platform, I only need to create a corresponding API client and build the relevant
publishers. Plus, I finally have code I'm not ashamed to push to GitHub.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/articles/2024-12-09-Revisiting-Lys-A-Eurovision-Flavored-Social-Media-Bot/lys_code_base.png)

With the same Lys processes now running 3 times a day, the read operations on my DynamoDB table spiked
and <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="I do perform full scans of the event table every 5 minutes like a baboon, after all. Who would've guessed!">
got dangerously close to the free tier limits</span>, and a long overdue, second refactoring was needed, to extract the
database querying out of the Lys publishing process so that it's only performed once.

### An API-less web calendar

OK this one is on paper dull as dirt but it's actually a cool one, because it's one of these instances where you have
to think about your use case first, and then start coding.

Eventually, I realized that it's a shame to sit on all of this data (I basically have an exhaustive calendar of
Eurovision pre-selections!) and only expose it through scheduled social media posts. Why not put together a nice little
web calendar?

The issue is - the data is locked away in an AWS DynamoDB table. To expose it to the internet, I would have to make it
flow through AWS' API Gateway, which sadly doesn't include any long term free tier offering, and comes with a few
extra considerations proper to public interfaces (authentication & authorization, volume, etc.).

I went back to my use case: I want my data to be displayed as a calendar on a web page. This data doesn't change very
often (at worst, a few times a
day, <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="There's nothing quite like the adrenaline rush of the RTSH YouTube stream for Festivali i K√´ng√´s being posted 30 minutes before the show">
to add a last minute link for example</span>), so I could do with a periodic extract (say, daily), even if that means I
have to manually trigger a refresh every now and then.

_An overview of the write volume to my "events" DynamoDB table during the peak of the Eurovision selection season (
January to mid March). Updates are largely concentrated in the morning (when I browse overnight date suggestions to
review) or in the evening (when I find a link for an upcoming show)._

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/articles/2024-12-09-Revisiting-Lys-A-Eurovision-Flavored-Social-Media-Bot/lys_dynamo_wcu_graph_2.png)

_OMG THE FIK FINAL STREAM LINK DROPPED EARLY!!_

I settled for an automated daily process that "dumps" the DynamoDB table to a JSON array, and pushes it to a GitHub
repository, essentially using GitHub raw as a public API. This process is handled by a separate Lambda that runs
everyday early in the morning - whatever change I make to the calendar will be reflected the next day, and if I really
need to push an update, I can simply re-run the lambda.

All that was left
was [writing some HTML, plugging a Javascript GET onto the raw URL](https://github.com/LysEurovision/lyseurovision.github.io/blob/web/index.html#L341),
wrapping the whole shebang in a GitHub Pages website and [voil√†](https://lyseurovision.github.io/)!

_The nerdy .github.io URL is well worth the monthly savings_

### Rebuilding the management app

I didn't care much about keeping the code base of the Android app that I built up to date and I, of course, lived to
regret it. But in my misfortune, I saw an
opportunity: <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="TLDR I quit everything to move to Bosnia and Herzegovina and marry the woman of my life - yes, you read that right ;)">
I was soon to be jobless</span>, and I thought I would fare better on the market in my upcoming job search with a few
extra skills under my belt - so I took to write a brand-new management app for Lys, with the aim to use a modern web
framework.

I settled for Next.js, and with the help of Tailwind CSS for display, [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for aggressive
caching, the AWS Javascript SDK, and Vercel for free hosting, I built
a <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="That was the number 1 requirement - I spend 95% of my online time on my phone, so this app had to be comfortable on mobile (and I legit don't give a sh%t about desktop - but I still went the extra mile and made it look good there too)">
100% responsive</span> webapp that I can access anywhere, does what the old app did and more,
and <span class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="If you're a fellow AWS free tier abuser, stop worrying about your Lambda runs and start keeping an eye on your DymamoDB R/WCU">
doesn't send a million and a half requests to DynamoDB</span>.

### What's next?

I do have a few ideas for Lys but nothing concrete yet. As I
mentioned [in my last blog post](https://corentindautreme.github.io/Making-Lys-A-Eurovision-Flavored-Twitter-Bot/), Lys
is a never-ending project, so who knows what I'll have to say in the next one. I do hope the future holds less fascist
billionaires resetting my API accesses to their newly acquired toy though.

Until then, you can
read [the previous blog post I wrote](https://corentindautreme.github.io/Making-Lys-A-Eurovision-Flavored-Twitter-Bot/)
about Lys, or check out the Lys section [on my portfolio](https://corentindautreme.github.io/portfolio) to get an
overview of the project.
