A [Javascript/CSS based generator](../esc-2021-generator) that recreates Eurovision 2021-like logos for different host cities, following the original concept of the official 2021 Eurovision Song Contest logo and based on the GPS coordinates of the capitals of all participating countries (see [this blog post](../Making-A-2021-Eurovision-Logo-Generator/) for more details on this project).
