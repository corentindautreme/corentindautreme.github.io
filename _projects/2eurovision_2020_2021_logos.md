A recreation of the data-based logos of the 2020 & 2021 Eurovision Song Contests using CSS. The final result can be found on CodePen ([2020](https://codepen.io/CorentinDautreme/pen/PowpmVe), [2021](https://codepen.io/CorentinDautreme/pen/MWjyjRv)), and I have retraced the process in a blog post ([2020](../Recreating-The-2020-Eurovision-Logo-Using-Css/), [2021](../Recreating-The-2021-Eurovision-Logo-Using-Css/)).
